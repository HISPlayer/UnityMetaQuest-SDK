#### string GetWidevineSecurityLevel(int playerIndex). Get the security level of the loaded Widevine DRM protected content as a string. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### float[][] GetAudioData(int playerIndex, int sampleSizePerChannel)
Get the audio PCM data of each channel in float array. The order of the channel is the same as the order of the stream's audio channel layout, e.g. C L R Ls Rs. The **playerIndex** is the index of the player in multistream properties, the **sampleSizePerChannel** is the requested data size of each audio channel. Please use this API when **UnityAudio** is set to true.

#### void FillAudioData(int playerIndex, float[] audioData, int channelIndex)
Fill the audio buffer with new audio PCM data. The **playerIndex** is the index of the player in multistream properties. The **audioData** is the audio buffer that will be filled with new audio data. The **channelIndex** is the index of the audio channel. The order of the channel index must be the same as the order of the stream's audio channel layout, e.g. C=0, L=1, R=2, Ls=3, Rs=4. Please use this API when **UnityAudio** is set to true.

#### int GetAudioSessionId(int playerIndex)
Provide the audio session identifier. The **playerIndex** is associated with the index of the element of **Multi Stream Properties**, e.g. the index 0 is the element 0 in the list.

#### void SynchronizeMultiStreams(int primaryPlayerIndex, int secondaryPlayerIndex, long offsetMs = 0)
Synchronizes the playback of secondary stream following the primary stream. The **primaryPlayerIndex** is the index of the main stream, the **secondaryIndexPlayer** is the index of the second stream that will be synchronized following the main stream. The **offsetMs** (Optional) is the time offset of the secondary player to synchronize with main player in milliseconds. Default value is 0 means both players playback are synchronized to the same timestamp. Put positive value if the secondary player should be played from a point ahead the main player’s current position. Put negative value if the secondary player should be played from a point behind the main player’s current position. The secondary stream will automatically seek following the main stream current time plus the offset. You may call this API after calling **SetUpPlayer**.

#### void SetLogLevel(LogLevel logLevel)
Establishes the amount of logs to be shown. The log levels are represented as an enum of integers. Every type of log whose representative integer is greater or equal to the established log level will be shown. This API should be called before **SetUpPlayer** or **AddStream** APIs.

#### string[] GetAvailableCodecs()
Get the available codecs list on the device. You may call this API before or after **SetUpPlayer**.

#### void SetExternalSurface(int playerIndex, IntPtr surface)
Set the external surface of a certain player to be used. This API will change the internal external surface if it already has been set before. Use this API when you change the overlay shape by passing the new surface. Please call this API after **OVROverlay.ExternalSurfaceObjectCreated** callback has been triggered and after **SetUpPlayer**.

#### void ReleaseExternalSurface(int playerIndex)
Release the external surface from a certain player. This API is optional, only call it before you setting OVROverlay enabled to false or before destroying it during runtime. Please call this API after **SetUpPlayer**.

#### void SetStereoscopicRendering(int playerIndex, HISPlayerStereoMode stereoMode, ref bool overrideRect, ref Rect srcRectLeft, ref Rect srcRectRight, ref Rect destRectLeft, ref Rect destRectRight)
Set stereoscopic rendering side by side or top/bottom. Only supported with external surface rendering mode. You may call this API before or after **SetUpPlayer**. The parameters marked with ref keyword can be retrieved from public properties of OVROverlay. Usage example: `SetStereoscopicRendering(streamIndex, HISPlayerStereoMode.LeftRight, ref overlay.overrideTextureRectMatrix, ref overlay.srcRectLeft, ref overlay.srcRectRight, ref overlay.destRectLeft, ref overlay.destRectLeft);`.
